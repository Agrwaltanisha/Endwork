sales = LOAD ‘sales_order_dataset’ USING PigStorage(‘,’) AS (region:chararray, item:chararray, units:int, rep:chararray);

– Group the sales by region sales_by_region = GROUP sales BY region;

– Calculate the maximum and minimum number of units sold per region 
max_units = FOREACH sales_by_region GENERATE group AS region, MAX(sales.units) AS max_units; 
min_units = FOREACH sales_by_region GENERATE group AS region, MIN(sales.units) AS min_units;

– Join the max and min units with the original sales data 
max_sales = JOIN max_units BY (region, max_units), sales BY (region, units); 
min_sales = JOIN min_units BY (region, min_units), sales BY (region, units);

– Display the results DUMP max_sales; 
DUMP min_sales;

– Group the sales by item and rep 
sales_by_item_rep = GROUP sales BY (item, rep);

– Count the number of unique items sold per rep 
unique_items = FOREACH sales_by_item_rep GENERATE FLATTEN(group) AS (item, rep), COUNT(sales) AS count;

– Display the results 
DUMP unique_items;
